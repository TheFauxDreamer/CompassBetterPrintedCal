# CompassBetterPrintedCal - WINDOWS TEST Version
This version is the same feature wise as the main branch, it just has better support for Chrome on Windows.

This has broken the Mac support a tad, and I use a Mac so we're in a seperate branch.

## Support:
This extension supports **Chrome** & **Chromium-based browsers**!

## How to install or test the unloaded version.

1. Download it from this Github, and save it somewhere useful.
2. Go to Chrome Settings using three dots on the top right corner.
3. Then Select Extensions.
4. Now, Enable developer mode
5. Click on Load Unpacked and select your unzipped folder you downloaded from here.

That's it!
