# CompassBetterPrintedCal
Provides an alternative to the stock printable calendar provided from the Compass Calendar module.

This is being created inbetween jobs & in my spare time, updates, feature requestest, & continued support aren't guaranteed.

## Functionality:
Add details here later...

## Limitations:
Without API access to Compass there are certain limitaions imposed on how we retrieve data & what data is available to us.
- We can only retrieve the calendar events currently visible to the user (if you're in day view we can only get today's events)
- Some user interaction is required as Term events aren't available by default and it's difficult to keep track of the current view

### Possible Future Features:
- Ability to capture all term data and combine into a full year overview

## Support:
This extension supports **Chrome** & **Chromium-based browsers**!

## How to install or test the unloaded version.

1. Download it from this Github, and save it somewhere useful.
2. Go to Chrome Settings using three dots on the top right corner.
3. Then Select Extensions.
4. Now, Enable developer mode
5. Click on Load Unpacked and select your unzipped folder you downloaded from here.

That's it!
